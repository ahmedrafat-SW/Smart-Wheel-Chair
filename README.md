# IOT Smart Wheelchair

## Abstract

- **There are many paralysis patients who suffer from the difficultyof using the chair for the traditional wheelchair,
 in addition to the fact that many of them also suffer from loneliness and the absence of anyone to care for them,
 based on that the idea of ourproject came.**

- **This project helps people with paralysis who have no one to
look after them either.**

- **The wheelchair is moved via a joystick or an Android app that
the patient uses to give four way movement commands (left,
right, forward, or backward).**

- **The patient can also move the chair by voice commands using
the same Android app.**

- **The wheelchair is equipped with an ultrasound sensor,
If the chair falls in any direction, a message will be sent via the
sensor to the hospital to obtain a rescue.**

- **The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used to send the exact
location of an infected patient so that the hospital sends someone
to rescue him.**

- **The wheelchair also has a sensor to sense the patient's body
temperature.**

- **All patient data read by the sensors is sent to the hospital in
order to send patient rescue when needed.**
